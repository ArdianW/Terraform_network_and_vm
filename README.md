# Terraform_network_and_vm

The Terraform project is designed to establish a virtual network with subnets and provision a flexible range of Linux virtual machines, ranging from 1 to 99. The project is structured into two modules: Network and VM. The Network module provides functionality for creating networks and subnets. Meanwhile, the VM module outlines the process of creating VM types, as well as the generation of NICs and disks for each VM.

As part of the project, the 'skip_provider = true' command was utilized due to insufficient permissions for registering providers.
